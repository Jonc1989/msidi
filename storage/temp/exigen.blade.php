                <p class="exigen-text white">Cooperation between MS-IDI and Exigen Services began at the end of 2012, when our company started actively seeking partners, and after brief negotiations,signed a contract for participation in the first project. This contributed to a number of reasons, the main among which is the fact that the management personnel of our company in its time (early 2000â€™s) was successfully working in the DATI Group, which later became Exigen Services. The project associated with design and prototyping, was launched in October 2012, and was successfully submitted after 2.5 months of development, then immediately was signed a contract for mobile solution developing for the iOS platform. Then followed other projects, mainly for large customers from the USA. The spectrum of technologies used in the projects: .NET programming, mobile solution development for iOS platform, prototyping and design.</p>

As practice shows a considerable distance from each other is not an obstacle for the successful implementation of projects. Currently all projects or its parts, provided for the development, were completed on time, and we have received only positive feedback from the Exigen Services side.</p>
