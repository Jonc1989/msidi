                    questionnaire, our company “MS-IDI” made the best offer, as a result contract was signed for the development of the website.

                    Modern building = timely web site.
                    Every resident and visitor of Rēzekne City can associate ARPC „Zeimuļs” with unusual
                    and modern architecture alongside with ancient castle ruins. MS-IDI task was to develop
                    a modern information site for people of all ages.  To develop site for customer needs,
                    whole program development cycle was made: analysis of customer needs; information system
                    projection and designing; coding; introduction and maintenance, user training, domain
                    purchase and resource file hosting, all together the development took 3 months.
                    Architecture of the site was made on open-source code system WordPress, using PHP and
                    JavaScript that were improved with unique MS-IDI developed design, together with already existing function expansion.

                    Development process was managed after Agile methodology, which ensured regular
                    accomplishment coordination with the customer and further development task approval.

                    Using non-typical thinking to find solutions.
                    As in every task, this time was no exception, we encountered some difficulties.
                    One of the most important things in the development process was the amount of information
                    that was necessary to include in the web site – there are 86 different activities going on
                    in the „Zeimuļs”, so all the events were imported from all the active years, a great amount
                    of graphic materials and other information. For lesson and event list special filters were
                    made that enabled the opportunity to find exactly what user is looking for, whether it’s an event or some kind of activity.

            establishing more effective and innovative IT solutions. Already in the near future different
            project plans might come true that would raise ARPC „Zeimuļs” efficiency and the quality of provided services.
