                RNIS mobile app is analog to customer self-service system – it duplicates the same information, because the customer portal, business management system and the mobile app has united database. Mobile app is developed on two platforms: Android (starting from Android 2.3.) and Apple (starting from iOS6). All mobile program platforms was developed using native platforms, therefore providing better user interface for information system. More time was dedicated for this development period, because mobile app wasn’t developed on cross-platform mode. For all that contributed work paid off with surprisingly easy UI for every device with no errors, which couldn’t be said if the app was developed on cross-platform mode.        </div>
