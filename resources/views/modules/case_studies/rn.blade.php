                    Until now, company has been using paper document accountancy that can complicate operations and can
                    cause other problems with customers. If 15 years ago paper documents were „another day in the office”,
                    then today it can cause slow work pace, slow response times and even document loss that can make customers
                    dissatisfied and direct money loss for company.

                    Every module has its own part in IS, e.g., maintenance management module provides the
                    opportunity to record maintenance work, basing on customers call, report,
                    inspection of the building or inhabitant general meeting. Or application management
                    module contains information about registered customer applications or reports.

                        One of the biggest RNIS user advantages is interactive map in self-service portal.
                        Interactive map shows the city of Rēzekne, accordingly marking the territory of „Rezeknes Namsaimnieks”.
                        The map is also a great way how customers are informed about the actions of the company. Every IS user
                        can see planned, ongoing or finished project in real time and see what has been done selecting specific
                        time period. Meetings, technical inspections and maintenance works are being highlighted using different fonts.

                        RNIS mobile app is analog to customer self-service system – it duplicates the same information,
                        because the customer portal, business management system and the mobile app has united database.
                        Mobile app is developed on two platforms: Android (starting from Android 2.3.) and Apple (starting
                        from iOS6). All mobile program platforms was developed using native platforms, therefore providing
                        better user interface for information system. More time was dedicated for this development period,
                        because mobile app wasn’t developed on cross-platform mode. For all that contributed work paid off
                        with surprisingly easy UI for every device with no errors, which couldn’t be
                        said if the app was developed on cross-platform mode.
