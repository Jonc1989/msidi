                    seeking partners, and after brief negotiations,signed a contract for participation in the first project. This contributed to a number
                    of reasons, the main among which is the fact that the management personnel of our company in its time (early 2000â€™s) was successfully
                    working in the DATI Group, which later became Exigen Services. The project associated with design and prototyping, was launched in October
                    2012, and was successfully submitted after 2.5 months of development, then immediately was signed a contract for mobile solution developing
                    for the iOS platform. Then followed other projects, mainly for large customers from the USA. The spectrum of technologies used in the
                    projects: .NET programming, mobile solution development for iOS platform, prototyping and design.
