The company's activity is aimed primarily at providing quality and affordable services to private and corporate clients.

                <p>In 2013 the " OPAL Transfer" already had the service management processes that have been developed for several years. During this time was gained a positive experience in organization of work on customer service, including  problematic situations management. During the whole time of using the system successful steps have been made to rethink the functional possibilities that was provided by solution used at that time  . Adding new options in that system was not possible due to the development time and its cost. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="medium-6 column no-pads-right">
                <p>The price of such costs was comparable with the development of a new project. Thus , the customer ( OPAL Transfer) faced the choice, familiar to many companies: either invest in the old inconvenient system upgrade, or switch to another, more functional software product that provides a qualitatively new level of work. Obviously, the choice was made in favour of the latter, so the " OPAL Transfer" prepared a prototype of the new information solution , and also provided a description of all business processes , implemented and working in the company. </p>

    <div class="row block no-pads">
        <p>For a decision making from the customer side was set the requirement: to start a project with already prepared development environment, i.e. to show several working forms. The architect of the company chose the three-tier architecture, which is shown below. </p>
        <img class="resp" src="http://ms-idi.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/diagamm.png">
        <p>As a base were selected 3rd parties   libraries (both paid and free), which are the most popular for the enterprise applications development : NHibernate, Kendo UI. As the platform basis was taken Microsoft ASP.NET MVC and Microsoft WCF. For connecting the entire infrastructure was created its own framework ( later called Itex), which contains the linking code , events logging, authentication and authorization , as well as other functions and utilities. </p>

        <p class="bop-beta-text">Obviously, in addition there were "standard" solutions for this kind of system: a variety of reports on financial transactions, work with clients , report on the operator's actions and other. In the system were introduced three types of users: super administrator, administrator, and operator. Besides, there was created the tree of rights, with which help it was possible to finely tune rights of each system user individually.

            <p class="bop-beta-text">Beta testing of the project was very intense: in the process were involved testers from both sides (the contractor's, and the client's). It should be also noted that from the customer's side in the final stages of development/testing was undertaken quite interesting step â money transfer was registered and processed in parallel in two systems: the old and the new one. It demanded from the customer's side just a little extra time, as the new system was focused primarily on the performance speed and convenience, but gave a great result:</p>

                <p class="bop-beta-list" style="display: list;">testing was as close to "combat" conditions, which allowed to identify the most "narrow" systems even before the launch, and in a timely manner find solutions;</p>
                <p class="bop-beta-list">at the time of the project launch operators were already fully prepared to work with the new system, allowing the client to redirect the savings to the further development of information solution;</p>

                <p>As a separate paragraph should be mentioned the data migration from the old system to the new, which also helped to reduce the startup time of the project. During the old system performance  have been transferred all the data, which in the transfer process was adapted to the new database structure and the new functionality. In fact, it was a mini -project in the project: has been created a separate independent application, which worked with the export files. The biggest difficulty in this part of the project was the amount of data: we are talking about millions of records , some of which was not exported correctly , so the different periods of export data had to be processed differently , up to corrections / editing manually. Our company has also successfully coped with this task: in the first couple months of the project came just a few requests to modify the migration data.    </p>
