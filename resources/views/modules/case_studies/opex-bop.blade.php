                clients call the speed of the transaction (up to 1 day), low cost (1% of the amount for the CIS
                countries and Â£3 for the Baltic and the Eastern Europe countries), service 7 days a week, and
                ease of completion of the transfer.

                    In 2013 the " OPAL Transfer" already had the service management processes that have been developed for several years.
                    During this time was gained a positive experience in organization of work on customer service, including
                    problematic situations management. During the whole time of using the system successful steps have been made
                    to rethink the functional possibilities that was provided by solution used at that time.
                    Adding new options in that system was not possible due to the development time and its cost.

                    The price of such costs was comparable with the development of a new project. Thus,
                    the customer ( OPAL Transfer) faced the choice, familiar to many companies: either
                    invest in the old inconvenient system upgrade, or switch to another, more functional
                    software product that provides a qualitatively new level of work. Obviously, the choice
                    was made in favour of the latter, so the " OPAL Transfer" prepared a prototype of the
                    new information solution , and also provided a description of all business processes,
                    implemented and working in the company.

                For a decision making from the customer side was set the requirement: to start a project with already
                prepared development environment, i.e. to show several working forms.
                The architect of the company chose the three-tier architecture, which is shown below.

                As a base were selected 3rd parties libraries (both paid and free), which are the most popular
                for the enterprise applications development : NHibernate, Kendo UI. As the platform basis was
                taken Microsoft ASP.NET MVC and Microsoft WCF. For connecting the entire infrastructure was
                created its own framework ( later called Itex), which contains the linking code , events
                logging, authentication and authorization , as well as other functions and utilities.

                were working 7 developers and management personnel.

                Obviously, in addition there were "standard" solutions for this kind of system: a variety of reports
                on financial transactions, work with clients , report on the operator's actions and other. In the system were introduced
                three types of users: super administrator, administrator, and operator. Besides, there was created the tree of rights,
                with which help it was possible to finely tune rights of each system user individually.

                Beta testing of the project was very intense: in the process were involved testers from both sides

                final stages of development/testing was undertaken quite interesting step â money transfer was registered
                and processed in parallel in two systems: the old and the new one. It demanded from the customer's side just a
                little extra time, as the new system was focused primarily on the performance speed and convenience, but gave a great result:

                As a separate paragraph should be mentioned the data migration from the old system to the new, which

                transferred all the data, which in the transfer process was adapted to the new database structure and
                the new functionality. In fact, it was a mini -project in the project: has been created a separate
                independent application, which worked with the export files. The biggest difficulty in this part of
                the project was the amount of data: we are talking about millions of records , some of which was not
                exported correctly , so the different periods of export data had to be processed differently , up to
                corrections / editing manually. Our company has also successfully coped with
                this task: in the first couple months of the project came just a few requests to modify the migration data.
