This part of the project enables carrying out the money transfers independently for both new and existing customers , without direct participation of the operator. Clients become fully independent from the Opal enterprise working time, and this operation can be carried out in any time of the day, which nowadays  is de facto. Should be noted that this step also helps to attract new customers.</p>

                    <p>The most important question that had to be solved during the development of this project was the user interface / website design. Firstly, what are the opportunities associated with the money transfers that  had to be provided to the clients and which – not, and secondly, the organization of the whole navigation (since some clients have very minimal knowledge in using computer/Internet, it was necessary to focus exactly on this part of the audience) and, thirdly, the color solution (very different from Opal: BOP). The project development was divided into two parts: </p>

                    <p>working on the user interface and the development itself . Working on the interface, in its turn, began with the development of the prototype. Using the Axure software, was created a prototype, which fully repeated the behavior of the developed project. Thus, already in the initial phase of development, we were able to show the client how the final product will look like . Accordingly, all corrections were made quickly and "painless" at first to  the prototype, and then to the developed product.</p>

                    <p>The business logic and access to the database of both Opal: BOP and and Opal: COM implemented as a web service (Microsoft WCF), which is used by the current web applications of the system, and in the future can support web applications of different types (for example, mobile clients). The web service is implemented in a RESTful style, which provides a fixed interface of the business logic function call  and access to resources, as well as  facilitates the operations and system errors logging development. </p>

                    <p>As the volume of the Opal: COM functional  was significantly less than in Opal: BOP, the number of developers for this project was reduced: on a permanent basis in the project were working 7 developers and management personnel. Besides, in various sprints were also involved designer, testers (both on the part of the contractor and the customer). </p>

The speed of development of this system allowed to establish the length of the sprint, equals one week. At the end of the next sprint on the pre-production server was installed bild for the client to test, and also sent a detailed report on the content generated by means of the Atlassian JIRA. </p>

The set before the project goals were completed: clients independently and simply can make the transfer of funds, client base is growing, and along with it the customer's profit.  </p>
